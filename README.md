# Gas-Leak-Detection-and-Alert-System-Using-PIC-Microcontroller-and-MQ2-Sensor
This project designs a gas leak detection and alert system using a PIC microcontroller and MQ2 gas sensor. The system monitors gas concentration levels and triggers alerts through LED indicators, a buzzer, and an LCD display when hazardous levels are detected, ensuring a timely response to gas leaks
